'''
Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input to compute gross pay.
Pay should be the normal rate for hours up to 40 and time-and-a-half for the hourly rate for all hours worked above 40 hours.
Put the logic to do the computation of pay in a function called computepay() and use the function to do the computationâ€¦
